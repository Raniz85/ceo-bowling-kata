        Correct!
        Unfortunately,
        this didn't mean that Mule won this time either,
        but Zerkk MacBurger won with a total score of 1053, very impressive!

        Anticipating a call from your manager,
        you find it hard to get started on anything else.
        Instead, in preparation of the next rule change you look through your CEO's series and plot the histogram of his
        rolls.
    </p>
    <pre>0 |============================================
 1 |===========================
 2 |============
 3 |==
 4 |==
 5 |
 6 |=
 7 |=
 8 |===
 9 |=======
10 |======</pre>
    <p>
        Looking at the data, it seems that your CEO bowls by throwing the heaviest ball he can find as hard as possible.
        A strategy that seems to produce a lot of misses, but also a fair number of strikes.
    </p>
    <p>
        When your manager comes over (no call this time) you quickly explain the situation and you both sit down to
        discuss potential rule changes that will favour this bowling style.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
        <li>If all ten pins are downed on the first roll it is deemed a strike and grants 10 points</li>
        <li>If all ten pins are downed by the second roll it is deemed a spare and grants 5 points</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        With these new rules, let's return to the example and calculate new scores:
    </p>
    <pre class="bg-base03 text-base0 p-2 rounded-xl mb-2">
Yattas Del Lana 3 5 3 5 7 2 3 0 10 4 3
Eve Stojbs 3 7 3 3 9 1 6 4 2 3 1 0</pre>
    <p>
        Dividing this up in frames we get:
    </p>
    <pre class="bg-base03 text-base0 p-2 rounded-xl mb-2">
Yattas Del Lana | 3 5 | 3 5 | 7 2 | 3 0 | 10  | 4 3
Eve Stojbs      | 3 7 | 3 3 | 9 1 | 6 4 | 2 3 | 1 0</pre>
    <p>
        Summing up the scores according to the new rules you arrive at:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
        <li>Yattas Delana: 3 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 10 + 10 (Strike) + 4 + 3 = 55
        <li>Eve Stojbs: 3 + 7 + 5 (Spare) + 3 + 3 + 9 + 1 + 5 (Spare) + 6 + 4 + 5 (Spare) + 2 + 3 + 1 + 0 = 57
    </ul>
    <p>
        And according to these rules Eve Stojbs is the winner with 57 points.
    </p>
    <p>
        Satisfied with the rule changes you go back to your other duties.
        It does't take long for the next scorecard to arrive though
        - apparently your CEO called up everyone else and strongarmed them into another round of bowling as soon as he got
        your rule changes.
    </p>
    <p>
    <p>
        Given the scores in the new <a href="series02.txt" target="_new">series</a>,
        calculate the winner and their final score.
