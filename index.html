        <p>
            Once upon a time, in a boardroom far, far away, a group of bored CEOs decided to play a game of bowling.
            Being high-school dropouts with limited understanding of maths,
            they couldn't grok the scoring rules of regular bowling and decided on a simplified version instead.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the latest hire you're tasked with calculating the scores for the latest meeting.
            The rules for CEO bowling is very simple:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
            <li>Players take turns making rolls in a frame, a frame consists of up to two rolls.</li>
            <li>The score for a frame is the total number of pins knocked down in that frame.</li>
            <li>There is no limit on the number of frames in a game of CEO-bowling; the game continues until the CEOs
                are
                bored and decide on doing something else.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The input to your assignment is a file where each row consists of the name of the CEO and a series of
            numbers
            representing all their rolls. Your assignment is to figure out who won and how many points they scored.
        </p>
        <p>
            To ease your implementation, the CEOs have provided an old scorecard for a short game played years ago.
            <pre class="bg-base03 text-base0 p-2 rounded-xl mb-2">
Yattas Del Lana 3 5 3 5 7 2 3 0 10 4 3
Eve Stojbs 3 7 3 3 9 1 6 4 2 3 1 0</pre>
            Summing up the scores you arrive at:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
            <li>Yattas Del Lana: 3 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 10 + 4 + 3 = 45
            <li>Eve Stojbs: 3 + 7 + 3 + 3 + 9 + 1 + 6 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 0 = 42
        </ul>
        <p>
            And can declare Yattas Del Lana the winner with 45 points.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given the scores in the provided <a href="series01.txt" target="_new">series</a>,
            calculate the winner and their final score.
        </p>
