# CEO Bowling Kata
This repository contains a kata intended for practicing TDD.

It is built using Tailwind and TypeScript. Future tasks in the kata are kept hidden by requiring the programmer to
solve the previous task and calculate the correct answer given some input. Since the next part is encrypted using
this answer, the programmer may not move on before correctly solving the tasks.

Encryption is done using Python and cryptography and decrypting is performed using WebCrypto APIs.
